# Tiny Tina's Worlderlands `.proto`s

> Based off of https://github.com/apocalyptech/bl3-cli-saveedit/tree/master/protobufs

[protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) message definitions for Tiny Tina's Worlderlands.

These were extracted directly from `Wonderlands.exe` with
[protodec](https://github.com/schdub/protodec). 

Many thanks to apocalyptech for documenting their process to get the `.proto`s.

These were compiled into typescript definitions using the `protoc` utility, as recommended by
[ts-proto](https://github.com/stephenh/ts-proto):

See `npm run gen-proto` (_this automatically runs if you decide to run this repo locally_)
